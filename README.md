## Sense of Humor Disclaimer

We believe in adding a touch of humor to everything we do, even code. So, while the script is busy downloading videos, here's a little joke for you:

> Why did the programmer go broke?
>
> Because he lost his domain in a bet.

We hope that brought a smile to your face!

## Downloading Progress

The script will now work its magic and download the requested videos. Sit tight and let the pixels fly!

If any errors occur during the process, don't panic. We're not perfect, but we try our best. The script will let you know if anything goes awry.

## Completed Download

Congratulations! You've successfully downloaded the Instagram videos. Give yourself a pat on the back!

However, if you didn't manage to download the desired number of videos, don't fret. Life doesn't always go as planned. The script will inform you of how many videos were actually found and downloaded.
